This is DDI-Codebook version 2.6 submitted for final review 2025-12-15.

THIS IS A REVISION of 2.5.1 and is backward compatible with 2.5 (a valid instance of DDI-Codebook 2.5 will 
validate against version 2.6).

The current publication includes the schemas, field-level documentation publication in 
HTML, and change documentation. Additional documentation on the use of DDI-Codebook 2.6 are published
as separate documents on the DDIAlliance.org product page for DDI-Codebook.

The continued development of DDI-Codebook reflects the work of the
committees and individuals who developed DDI versions 1.0 - 2.5 as well as the collective
ideas, needs, and work of the Scientific Community of the DDI Alliance.
